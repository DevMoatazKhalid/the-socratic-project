"""
Centralised authorisation. Every route gets its data through these functions; they are the application-layer twin of
the RLS helpers in migration 013 (same rules, so the Data API and the backend can never disagree).

Rules:
  * everything is scoped to the caller's university;
  * a student reaches a classroom only through an ACTIVE enrolment, and an assignment only if it is PUBLISHED;
  * an instructor reaches a course if they are its instructor or teach one of its classrooms;
  * "exists but not yours" and "does not exist" are both 404, so identifiers cannot be probed.
